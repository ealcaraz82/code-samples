# code-samples
The following samples are redacted and edited for public display.  The java files include Android code that demonstrate the use of Fragments and construction and use of a Database.  The cpp files are from a game engine I developed in DirectX8 back in the day.  They demonstrate classic structure, use of extrernal APIs, and multihreading. They are all original and all copyrights belong to Emmanuel Alcaraz Velarde and cannot be used in other projects without permission.
