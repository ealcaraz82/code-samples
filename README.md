# code-samples
The following samples are heavily redacted and edited for public display.  The java files include Android code that demonstrate the use of a Navigation Drawer, New Material Design Toolbar, Material Design compatible Fragments, and construction and use of a Database.  The cpp files are from a game engine I developed in DirectX8 back in the day.  They demonstrate classic structure, server/client messaging, parsing of raw 3D geometry X files, use of external APIs, and multihreading. They are all original and all copyrights belong to Emmanuel Alcaraz Velarde and cannot be used in other projects without permission.
